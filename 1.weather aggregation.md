Weather Data Aggregation

Overview
This project includes a Python function designed to aggregate weather data from a CSV file. The function reads weather records, calculates the average temperature and humidity for each city, and handles missing or invalid data gracefully.

Functionality
weather_data(file_path): Aggregates temperature and humidity data for each city from the provided CSV file.

File Structure
weather_data.py: Contains the Python function to aggregate weather data.
top100cities_weather_data.csv: Sample CSV file containing weather data.


Requirements
Python 3.x
Google Colab (or any Python environment)

Instructions
Upload the CSV File:
Use Google Colab's file upload feature to upload top100cities_weather_data.csv into the Colab environment.

Run the Code:
file- 1_Average_temp_and_humidity

Open a new notebook in Google Colab.
Copy the weather_data function into a cell in the notebook.
Set the file_path variable to the path of the uploaded CSV file.
Execute the cell to run the function and print the results.
